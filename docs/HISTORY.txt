Changelog for plone.app.content

    (name of developer listed in brackets)

plone.app.content - 1.0.6 - UNRELEASED

    - Update the folder_factories view to add the FTI id to the output of 
      of addable_types. This makes it possible for callers to manipulate its
      results.

plone.app.content - 1.0.5

    - Fixed the 'id' attribute of CMFAdding class. By default, it is an
      empty string, which confuses absolute_url() and causes the <base />
      tag to be set incorrectly. This in turn confuses KSS, and probably
      other things.

plone.app.content - 1.0

    - Fixed missing i18n markup on the folder contents view.

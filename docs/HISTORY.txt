  [wichert]


1.1.1 - March 24, 2008
----------------------

- Improved the batch disabling action so that it only shows up
  when there is a batch.
  [jvloothuis]

- Made the reviewlist more powerful by making the folder contents
  selection features available for it as well.
  [jvloothuis]

- Changed the replacement command to actually replace the div, not
  just its inner content. This fixes a problem with browsers like
  Internet Explorer which did not apply the drag and drop script
  after updating.
  [jvloothuis]

- Fixed i18n markup in table.pt.
  [hannosch]


1.1.0 - March 8, 2008
---------------------

- Made it possible to show all the items in the folder contents at
  once (no batching). This can be used to drag items across batch
  boundaries and makes it easier to move an item from the end of
  the folder to the beginning.
  [jvloothuis]

- Update the folder_factories view to add the FTI id to the output of 
  of addable_types. This makes it possible for callers to manipulate its
  results.
  [wichert]

- Fixed the 'id' attribute of CMFAdding class. By default, it is an
  empty string, which confuses absolute_url() and causes the <base />
  tag to be set incorrectly. This in turn confuses KSS, and probably
  other things.
  [optilude]


1.0 - August 16, 2007
---------------------

- Fixed missing i18n markup on the folder contents view.
  [hannosch]
